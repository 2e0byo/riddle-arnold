PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION
The present work will be found to supply a desideratum that has long been felt by the classical student. The preface of the English editors will show the various sources whence they have culled their materials; while an examination of the volume itself will convince any one how successfully they have accomplished the object which they proposed themselves in preparing it. We have had, in fact, no work before this, on the same subject, in the English language, at all deserving of being compared with the present one, and it is to be hoped that the wretched compliations which have hitherto been used will now be completely discarded. No teacher, indeed, can retain them after this, who is conscientious in his vocation, and sincere in his efforts for the improvement of his pupils. It seems unneccessary, at the present day, to say any thing in favor of frequent practice in Greek and Latin composition. No one can be an accurate scholar without it. Whether a work like the present one is likely to be a useful aid in pursuing such a practice, the following remarks of Lipsius will satisfactorily decide: “Lectio non sufficit, imo nec felicissima memoria; sed opus est excerptis quibusdam et notis rerum verborumque singularium, quas imitemur. Quae excerpta memorialibus libellius, tanquam aerario, contineri velim, unde sermonis illae opes per tempus et ad usum promantur.” - Epist. Institut. c. xii.
In preparing the present edition for the press, numerous corrections have been silently made in the body of the work, and various improvements introduced, all tending to make the volume a more useful one. What will be found, however, to give the American edition a decided advantage over the English work, is the Dictionary of Proper Names, which is wanting in the latter. This has been prepared from the best sources, but more particularly Quicherat’s “Vocabulaire des Noms Géographiques, Mythologiques, et Historiques de la Langue Latine,” Mühlmann’s “Verzeichniss der geographischen, mythologischen, und geschichtlichen Namen,” Freund’s “Wörterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache,” Klotz’s “Handwörterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache” (as far as published), Sharpe’s “Nomenclator Poëticus,” Leusden’s “Onomasticon” &c., and Bischoff und Möller’s “Vergleichendes Wörterbuch der alten, mittleren und neuen Geographie.”
It remains but to add that the present work has enjoyed the careful supervision of the editor’s learned and accurate friend and colleague, Professor Drisler, a circumstance of no small importance as regards the utility of the book.
